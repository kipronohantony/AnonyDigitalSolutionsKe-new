Replace this file with the Google Search Console verification HTML file or token provided by Google.
For example, after verifying in Search Console you may upload the exact file named like:
googleXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.html
Or add the meta tag they provide into `index.html`.

This placeholder exists so you have a convenient place to add the verification file.
